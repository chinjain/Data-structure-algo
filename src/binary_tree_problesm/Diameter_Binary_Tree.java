	 * Approach to solve this problem is : 
	 * 
	 * we need to declare one global variable and update it to the same 
	 * 
	 * We will calculate the left Height of the tree & Right height of the tree
	 * 
	 * and find the max of (max , lh+rh) for that calling node 
	 * 
	 * now we will take the diameter for which we need to find the max of LH & RG + 1 to fetch the value of it
